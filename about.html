  <h1>About QuakeSound</h1>
  <p><strong>QuakeSound</strong> is a generative soundscape web application that transforms real-time earthquake data into musical tones.</p>

  <p>Each earthquake plays a sound where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pitch</strong> = Magnitude (higher magnitude = higher pitch)</li>
    <li><strong>Note length</strong> = Depth (shallower = longer resonance)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The app uses the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes" target="_blank">USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed</a> and visualizes seismic activity on a Leaflet.js map with OpenStreetMap tiles. Sounds are generated using the Web Audio API in real time.</p>

  <h2>Modes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://quakesound.com/">Real-Time Mode</a> — Shows and plays quakes from the past hour. Notes play on arrival.</li>
    <li><a href="https://quakesound.com/allday/">Soundscape Mode</a> — Plays all quakes from the past day sequentially and loops continuously for an ambient effect.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This project was created by <a href="https://github.com/AlexAmorBot" target="_blank">Alex Amor</a> and inspired by an exhibit at the Science Museum of Minnesota. It reflects a curiosity for turning real-world phenomena into interactive applications through sound, spatial visualization, and open-source tools. The development also demonstrates how modern AI can accelerate creative problem-solving, experimentation, and bring long-standing ideas to life.</p>
